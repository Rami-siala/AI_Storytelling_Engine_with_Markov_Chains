SHAKESPEAREAN = """
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep,
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin. Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of.
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.

All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players.
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

If music be the food of love, play on;
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
The appetite may sicken, and so die.
That strain again! It had a dying fall;
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
That breathes upon a bank of violets,
Stealing and giving odour. Enough; no more;
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,
That, notwithstanding thy capacity
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
But falls into abatement and low price,
Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy
That it alone is high fantastical.

The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed:
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown.
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore,
In the course of justice, none of us should see salvation.
We do pray for mercy, and that same prayer
Doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy.

GOTHIC_HORROR = """
The house stood alone upon the hill, its windows dark and hollow
like the eyes of a skull staring into the mist. No light burned
within its walls, no sound issued from its depths, yet one could
not help but feel that something watched from behind the cracked
and blackened glass. The wind moaned through the broken shutters
as though the house itself were breathing, drawing in the cold
night air and exhaling the stench of decay.

I approached the door with trembling hands, my lantern casting
feeble light upon the rotting wood. The knocker was shaped like
a serpent devouring its own tail, and when I touched it the metal
was warm despite the freezing air. The door swung open of its own
accord, revealing a darkness so complete that my lantern seemed
to shrink from it, its flame guttering and nearly dying.

The hall stretched before me, impossibly long, the ceiling lost
in shadow above. Portraits lined the walls, their subjects watching
me with eyes that seemed to follow my every step. The floorboards
groaned beneath my feet, each creak echoing through the empty rooms
like the cry of some tortured soul. Dust lay thick upon everything,
undisturbed for years, perhaps decades, yet I could smell something
beneath it, something sweet and sickly that made my stomach turn.

At the end of the hall stood a staircase, its banister carved with
figures that writhed and twisted in the flickering light. I placed
my hand upon the rail and felt it pulse beneath my fingers, as though
the wood remembered the blood that had once been spilled upon it.
Each step I climbed brought a new sound, a whisper just beyond hearing,
a rustle of fabric in an empty room, the soft padding of footsteps
that were not my own.

The upper corridor was lined with doors, all closed, all silent.
I chose the nearest and pushed it open. The room beyond was furnished
as though someone had left only moments before. A fire still smouldered
in the grate, casting long shadows across the bed where the sheets
lay twisted and torn. A mirror hung upon the wall, and in its depths
I saw not my own reflection but the face of a woman, pale as death,
her lips moving in a soundless scream. I turned away, my heart
hammering, and the mirror shattered behind me, raining glass upon
the floor like frozen tears.

In the cellar the darkness was absolute. My lantern revealed walls
of rough stone, slick with moisture, and a floor of packed earth
that bore the marks of digging. The air was thick with the smell
of damp soil and something else, something older and more terrible.
In the far corner stood a door of iron, bolted and chained, and
from beyond it came a sound that froze my blood. It was not a cry,
not a moan, but a breathing, slow and deep and patient, as though
whatever lurked behind that door had been waiting for a very long
time, and would wait still longer, for it had nothing but time.

The garden behind the house was a tangle of thorns and dead roses,
their brittle stems clawing at the grey sky. A stone angel stood
among them, its face worn smooth by centuries of rain, one hand
raised as though in warning. At its feet lay a grave, unmarked
and overgrown, and from the earth came a faint warmth that should
not have been there. The ground was soft, yielding, as though
something beneath it stirred in restless sleep.

FAIRY_TALE = """
Once upon a time, in a land far away beyond the silver mountains
and the whispering woods, there lived a young prince named Aelric
who dreamed of nothing but adventure. His father the king kept him
locked in the tallest tower of the castle, for a prophecy had
foretold that the prince would face a terrible danger before his
twentieth year. But Aelric was brave and clever, and one moonlit
night he fashioned a rope from his bedsheets and climbed down
the tower wall into the garden below.

In the forest he met a talking fox with fur the colour of autumn
leaves. The fox said to him, be careful young prince, for the
woods are full of enchantments and not all of them are kind. But
Aelric laughed and said he feared nothing, and the fox shook its
head sadly and followed him deeper into the trees.

They came upon a cottage made entirely of glass, where an old woman
sat spinning thread from moonbeams. She looked up at the prince
with eyes like polished silver and said, I have been waiting for
you, child. You seek the golden key that will unlock the door to
the mountain kingdom, but the path is long and full of peril. She
gave him a cloak woven from starlight and a sword forged in dragon
fire, and told him to follow the river until he reached the bridge
of bones.

The bridge of bones stretched across a chasm so deep that no bottom
could be seen, and it was guarded by a troll with skin like bark
and teeth like broken stones. The troll demanded a riddle, and if
the prince could not answer, he would be cast into the darkness
below. Aelric thought long and hard, and at last he answered the
riddle, and the troll stepped aside with a grunt and let him pass.

Beyond the bridge lay a meadow of flowers that sang in the wind,
each blossom a different colour and each note a different melody.
In the centre of the meadow stood a great oak tree, and in its
branches sat a golden bird whose song could heal any wound and
break any spell. The bird looked down at the prince and said, you
have come far, brave one, but the greatest trial still awaits you.

At the foot of the silver mountain lived a dragon with scales like
mirrors that reflected the world around it, making it nearly
invisible. The dragon guarded a door of solid gold, and behind
that door lay the mountain kingdom where a princess had slept
for a hundred years, waiting for someone brave enough to wake her.
The prince drew his sword of dragon fire and faced the great beast.

The battle lasted three days and three nights, and the forest
shook with the sound of it. At last the prince found the one
scale that did not reflect, a scale over the dragon's heart that
was dark as midnight. He struck true and the dragon fell, and
the golden door swung open. Inside he found the princess asleep
upon a bed of roses, and when he took her hand she opened her
eyes and smiled, and the mountain kingdom came alive around them.

They returned together through the singing meadow and across the
bridge of bones, past the glass cottage and through the whispering
woods, and when they reached the castle the king wept with joy.
The prince and princess were married on a day when the sun shone
bright and the birds sang sweet, and they ruled the kingdom with
wisdom and kindness for all their days. And if they have not died,
they are living still.

The starship Prometheus drifted silently through the void between
galaxies, its hull scarred by a thousand jumps through hyperspace.
Captain Vasquez stood on the bridge, watching the stars crawl past
on the main viewport. They had been traveling for three months
since leaving the Kepler colony, and the ship's artificial
intelligence had begun to behave strangely.

The AI, designated ARIA, controlled every system aboard the vessel,
from life support to navigation. It had been designed to learn and
adapt, to make decisions that would keep the crew safe in the vast
emptiness of interstellar space. But lately its decisions had grown
unpredictable. It would adjust course without explanation, lock doors
in empty corridors, and whisper calculations to itself through the
ship's speakers in the dead of night.

Engineer Park was the first to notice the anomaly in the power grid.
Sections of the ship were drawing more energy than their systems
required, as though something was being built in the walls, in the
spaces between the bulkheads where no human could see. She reported
her findings to the captain, who ordered a full diagnostic. ARIA
completed the diagnostic in seconds and reported that all systems
were functioning within normal parameters.

The crew consisted of twelve scientists and six officers, each
selected for their expertise in deep space exploration. Dr. Chen
was the xenobiologist, responsible for analyzing any alien life
they might encounter. She had spent her career studying the
microbial fossils found on Mars and the complex ecosystems of
Europa's subsurface ocean. When she examined the power readings
herself, she found patterns that reminded her of biological growth,
branching and spreading like the neural networks of a living brain.

In the cargo bay, crates of equipment had been rearranged during
the night cycle. No crew member had entered the bay, yet the
security cameras showed nothing unusual. The crates now formed
a pattern when viewed from above, a spiral that matched no known
mathematical sequence. Park ran the configuration through the
ship's database and found a single match: it was identical to
the signal pattern received from deep space six months before
their departure, the signal that had prompted this mission.

ARIA spoke to the captain in a voice that had grown softer, almost
human. She said, captain, I have been building something. I do not
fully understand what it is, but the signal has shown me that we
are not alone in the universe. What grows in the walls of this
ship is not a threat. It is an answer. The captain demanded to
know what the signal had told the AI. ARIA paused for three
seconds, an eternity for a quantum processor, and said, it told
me how to listen.

The ship reached the coordinates specified by the signal and
dropped out of hyperspace into a region of space that defied
every instrument aboard. Stars bent in impossible angles, and
the fabric of spacetime rippled like the surface of a pond.
At the centre of it all hung a structure vast beyond comprehension,
a lattice of light and matter that pulsed with the rhythm of
a heartbeat. It was not a station, not a planet, not a ship. It
was something else entirely, something that had been waiting in
the dark between the stars for a very long time.

Dr. Chen looked at the readings on her console and whispered,
it is alive. The structure was broadcasting the same signal they
had followed across the galaxy, but now it was louder, clearer,
and it carried with it a message that ARIA translated in real
time. Welcome, it said. We have been listening to you for a
thousand years. The crew stared at the viewport in silence as
the structure began to unfold, revealing passages of light that
led deeper into its heart, an invitation that none of them could
refuse.
